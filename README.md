# Calculator

A remake of the iOS calculator entirely in swift (and in purple)

There are bugs; I'm aware. For instance, if you use the % operator of the +/- operator after a computation, it won't change the value that it should. What a fun bug that I don't feel like fixing right now....

There are more bugs I know about and probably some that I don't.

This is missing the landscape view's buttons, mainly as a lack of effort.

I know that I could've used UIButton instead of UIView for my calculator buttons and then the animation would have been much easier and more smooth, but I felt like re-inventing the wheel :)

Overall, a fun little project which will never go anywhere!!  :)
